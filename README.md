**3Commas FTX Triggers**

This collection of scripts creates a set of trading bots on [3Commas.io](https://3commas.io/?c=tc161202) based on available perpetual futures on [FTX.com](https://ftx.com/#a=10167807), and automatically provides triggers for those bots to start deals.

You'll need connected accounts on both [3Commas.io](https://3commas.io/?c=tc161202) and on [FTX.com](https://ftx.com/#a=10167807) for this to work. For more on how to connect 3Commas to FTX, checkout [this guide](https://onepercent.blog/2021/04/25/connect-your-3commas-account-to-ftx-com/).

To use:

1. Download/copy the files to a folder on your machine and install any dependancies. These will most likely be [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) and [Py3CW](https://github.com/bogdanteodoru/py3cw).
2. Rename `example.config.py` to `config.py`, and edit the file to include your API keys and bot preferences.
3. Run the `Py3c_create.py` script to generate the 3Commas bots. This will also create a few tex files which include a list of trading pairs ignored if minimum size requirements aren't met, as well as a bot id list for both long and short bots.
4. Run the `Py3c_update.py` script and choose the **Enable bots** option.
5. Run the `Py3c_triggers.py` script to let the fun begin.  

More details on all the config settings, how the script works, and how to run continuously without leaving your computer on 24/7, will follow soon. 

Note: It happens that the trigger script crashes sometime (due to bad network, connetion errors, etc). In order, to run continuously the script and restart it automatically when it crashes, it is possible to run it as a service on a linux machine (or other OS as desired). See Py3c_triggers.service for an exemple of a service file to be used on a RaspberryPi.
